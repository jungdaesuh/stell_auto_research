name: setup-harness
description: Interactive first-time setup of the autoresearch harness for the user's own optimizer (simsopt, DESC, or any other). Detects their solver stack, installs missing dependencies, generates a solver adapter + campaign program file, and ends with a real run. Use when a collaborator clones this repo, when wiring the harness to a new solver, or to regenerate the program file for a new campaign.

# setup-harness

Get a first-time user from a fresh clone to a running experiment loop against
**their own optimizer**. The harness does not do the physics — the user owns
that. It runs their parameter scans, records every run (and every failure) in a
queryable SQLite DB, and keeps an append-only `LESSONS.md`. Your job here is to
wire it to their solver and prove it runs.

The end state is five pieces, all verified by a real run:
**adapter** (`adapter.py` → `adapters/<solver>.py`, the solver-specific glue) +
**program file** (`program_<slug>.md`, the agent's instructions) + **run.py**
(generic runner, untouched) + **results.db/jsonl** (experiment DB) +
**LESSONS.md** (research memory).

Run the phases in order. Be concrete, verify every step, and do not declare
done on a red smoke run. The user may be new to autoresearch and skeptical that
an LLM helps with their optimization — keep the walkthrough practical and
honest; the value you deliver is a working runner + bookkeeping, not physics.

## Phase 1 — Preflight: learn the contract

Read these before asking anything:
1. `contract.py` — the harness↔adapter contract. This is the interface the
   generated adapter must implement (`NAME`, `SOLVER_MODES`, `ENV_REQUIREMENTS`,
   `add_arguments`, `run_experiment`) and the `ExperimentOutcome` it returns.
2. `run.py` — the generic core: how it calls the adapter, the CLI skeleton, the
   env/artifact layout (`OUTPUT_BASE` / `KEEP_ARTIFACTS` / `ARTIFACTS_DIR`), and
   `COLUMN_METRIC_KEYS` (the canonical metric keys that get their own DB column;
   everything else an adapter emits lands in the `metrics` JSON overflow).
3. `adapters/simsopt_banana.py` — the **reference adapter**: a complete worked
   example of the contract. You will model the generated adapter on this.
4. `templates/program_template.md` — the program-file skeleton you fill later.

Do not read or write dotenv files; the harness is configured from exported
environment variables.

## Phase 2 — Identify the solver stack

Ask the user (AskUserQuestion, with detected defaults where possible):
- **Which optimizer** do they run — simsopt, DESC, or something else?
- **Where it lives**: the solver repo root, and the Python interpreter that has
  it installed (often a conda/venv distinct from this repo's env).
- **Target configurations**: the directory holding the inputs each experiment
  optimizes against (simsopt: `wout_*.nc` equilibria; DESC: base cases / `.h5`).

Verify each path immediately (dir exists; interpreter runs). If the user's
optimizer **is** the banana/simsopt reference, the shipped `adapter.py` already
works — confirm, skip adapter generation (Phase 6's adapter step), and just do
dependency check + campaign identity + program generation + smoke. Otherwise you
will generate a new adapter for their solver.

## Phase 3 — Dependencies (hard gate before introspection)

A solver whose imports fail produces confusing crashes later, so resolve this
first:
1. Probe the chosen interpreter for the framework and its key deps:
   `<python> -c "import simsopt"` / `"import desc"` (DESC also pulls `jax`).
2. If anything is missing, **guide the install** — do not silently run a heavy
   install:
   - Detect the user's package manager (uv / pip / conda) from their env.
   - For framework install commands, fetch **current** instructions rather than
     guessing — use the `find-docs` skill or `ctx7` (DESC + jax versions and
     CPU/GPU extras drift, and a wrong jax build is a classic silent failure).
   - Show the exact command, get confirmation, run it, then **re-verify the
     import**. No silent fallback.
3. Do not proceed to introspection until every required import succeeds.

## Phase 4 — Understand the solver & sketch the adapter

You are about to write an adapter; learn the solver's shape first.
1. **How is one experiment invoked?** A single script/subprocess (like banana's
   stage2), or a **chained pipeline** of several steps where each step's output
   feeds the next? (DESC umbilic, e.g., is a 4-step chain per parameter set:
   build a bumped plasma surface → solve the fixed-boundary equilibrium → stage-2
   coil optimization → free-boundary equilibrium seeded from the earlier solve.)
2. **Inputs/params** the agent should be able to set (grep the solver's argparse
   or function signatures). These become `add_arguments` flags.
3. **Outputs**: what does a run produce, and where are the metrics — a
   `results.json`, a returned object, stdout? This becomes `run_experiment`'s
   parsing.
4. **Metrics → canonical keys**: list the solver's native metric names and map
   each onto a canonical snake_case key. Keys in `run.py`'s `COLUMN_METRIC_KEYS`
   get a dedicated column; everything else is preserved in the `metrics` JSON
   blob (so nothing is lost — no schema change needed).
5. **Target-configuration resolution**: how a `--equilibrium`/base-case key maps
   to an actual input file or case.
6. **Validation / intermediates**: any independent check (field-line tracing,
   convergence) that should set `validated`, and any expensive intermediate a
   later step reuses.

## Phase 5 — Campaign identity & setup decisions (interview)

Free-text, the user's physics, not yours. Keep it lean — guardrails remove agent
freedom; physics findings belong in `LESSONS.md`, not here.
- **Campaign title** + 2–5 sentence **mission**.
- **Success metric**: the one measurable claim that defines success, and how it
  is verified.
- **Hard invariants**: hardware limits, sign/convention contracts, ceilings.
  Offer "none yet" as valid. Remind: every entry removes agent freedom — keep to
  real physical/hardware limits.
- **Constraint floors**: the buildability limits (offer the adapter's defaults
  as baseline).
- **Execution policy**: timeout and thread count for this machine; autonomy
  ("never stop" loop vs bounded sessions).
- **Artifact layout**: `OUTPUT_BASE` (scratch; crashed runs leave dir + run.log
  here), `KEEP_ARTIFACTS` (`none`/`pass`/`all`; recommend `pass`), `ARTIFACTS_DIR`,
  and any solver-specific seed/intermediate store the adapter needs.
- **Experiment granularity (multi-step pipelines only)**: ask whether one
  experiment should be **one DB row** (simplest — one row per full pipeline run)
  or **one row per sub-step** (more plumbing, but lets the agent reuse an
  expensive intermediate — e.g. a solved equilibrium — across downstream scans).
  Per-step uses the `experiment_group` column to tie a parameter set's rows back
  together, plus an archival hook to thread the intermediate forward. Default to
  one-row-per-chain unless they want the reuse.

## Phase 6 — Generate

1. **Adapter** (`adapters/<solver-slug>.py`) — implement the `contract.py`
   interface, modeling `adapters/simsopt_banana.py`:
   - `NAME`, `SOLVER_MODES` (the `--solver` choices; a single-shot solver has
     one mode, a pipeline may expose several), `ENV_REQUIREMENTS`.
   - `add_arguments(parser)` — register `--equilibrium` plus every solver param
     the agent may set, with the solver's real defaults. Only flags the solver
     actually supports.
   - `run_experiment(args, run_dir)` — run one experiment end-to-end (one
     subprocess, or the full chain), parse outputs, map metrics → canonical keys,
     classify pass/fail, run any validation, archive any reusable intermediate,
     and return an `ExperimentOutcome`. Must not raise on solver failure — return
     a `crash`/`fail` outcome (the core catches truly-unexpected exceptions).
     For per-step granularity, emit one outcome per step with `experiment_group`.
   - Read config via `require_env` from `contract.py` (fail-fast at import).
   - Point `adapter.py`'s re-export at the new module.
2. **Environment exports** — shell `export` commands from the interview: the
   solver root, interpreter, config dir, and any non-default artifact-layout
   values. Omit anything left at default.
3. **`program_<campaign-slug>.md`** — fill every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in
   `templates/program_template.md` from the interview + introspection:
   parameter table (only real flags), target-configuration table, artifact
   layout, success metric, hard invariants, constraint floors. Leave deferred
   sections as short "TODO — fill in as lessons accumulate" notes; do not invent
   physics. Remove all template HTML comments from the generated file.
4. **`LESSONS.md`** — shipped with the repo; do not overwrite. If missing,
   restore the scaffold from git.

## Phase 7 — Verify (must end green)

1. Run one tiny experiment through `run.py` with the env exports active and the
   smallest meaningful settings (low iterations/resolution, short timeout).
   Expect a single JSON line with a `"status"` and a new row in both
   `results.jsonl` and `results.db`.
2. If it crashes, read the run log (path printed in stderr / under
   `OUTPUT_BASE`), diagnose (usually a missing dep, an adapter↔solver flag
   mismatch, target-config resolution, or a broken pipeline step), fix, re-run.
   Do not declare setup done with a failing smoke run.
3. For a chained pipeline, run one reduced-resolution full parameter set to prove
   every step and the artifact hand-offs work end-to-end.
4. Leave smoke rows in the DB by default — they are honest history; clean up only
   if the user asks.

## Phase 8 — Report & how to run

Print a short, practical summary:
- The adapter written (`adapters/<slug>.py`) and that `adapter.py` now points at
  it; the program file (`program_<slug>.md`).
- The environment variables that must be exported before running, as a copy-paste
  block.
- Any adapter↔solver flag drift found and how it was resolved.
- **The first real launch command**, e.g.
  `python run.py --solver <mode> --equilibrium <case> [params]`.
- **How to start the loop**: "Read `program_<slug>.md`, then start the
  optimization loop."
- Reminders: `LESSONS.md` is append-only memory; the program file is the
  contract; query results with `sqlite3 results.db`; re-run `/setup-harness` for
  a new campaign or solver (it generates under a new slug / adapter rather than
  overwriting).
